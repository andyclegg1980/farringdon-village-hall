Planning Permission has been granted for a Village Hall on land between The Royal Oak and Marelands.

EHDC Planning Authority has approved our application to create a village hall with associated green space on Marelands field, on the A32 next to the Royal Oak.

As with all developments, there are conditions that must be satisfied before the build may commence.
