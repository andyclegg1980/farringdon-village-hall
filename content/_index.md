Welcome to the website dedicated to providing a Village Hall for Farringdon, and the Charity through which we'll achieve it. The website is still "a work in progress", but it will become increasingly more comprehensive in the information it provides.

***GRANTED***. EHDC Planning Authority has approved our application to create a village hall with associated green space on Marelands field, on the A32 next to the Royal Oak.

As with all developments, there are conditions that must be satisfied before the build may commence.
